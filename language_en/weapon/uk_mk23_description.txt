[Weapon Reference]
WeaponName=Mk. 23 Mod 3
WeaponDescriptiveName=Mark 23 "Grog" Submarine Torpedo
WeaponDescription=A modified Mark 20 with a wire-guidance system between the battery compartment and the afterbody. Development started in the 1950s with the prototype being tested in 1955 but was not issued for service use until 1966 and did not become fully operational until 1971. At that time, it was obsolescent and too slow to catch modern submarines, but was issued as an interim torpedo pending the appearance of the Mark 24.
