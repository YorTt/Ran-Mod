ShipClass=Jiangwei II
Description=Jiangwei II-class Type 053H3 Guided Missile Frigate
Aircraft=1 Z-9 Dauphin Helicopter
History=The Jiangwei II is a much more capable follow-on design to the earlier Jiangwei I frigate, featuring a 6-cell SAM launcher on the foredeck, along with improved radar-controlled Type 630 30mm guns that offer anti-missile capability. The missile battery is larger, featuring eight box launchers in two groups of four, which carry the YJ-83 anti-ship missile or CY-1 anti-submarine missile. Additional ASW weaponry comprise extended-range ASW mortars, and launchers for ASW torpedoes. A hangar and helipad provide these ships with ASW helicopter capability. Along with the larger Luhu destroyer, these ships make up the 'high end' of the PLAN's high/low mix.
